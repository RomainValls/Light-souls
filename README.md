## Presentation 

Light-souls is a quest based game, where the player has to go through 3 different levels before getting to the Final Boss.

Every level has 2 Non Playable Characters that the player has to encounter.

The 2 NPCs will give the player challenges, and eventually reward him of a sword if successfully passed. 

The final boss throws flames and swords at you, but you can get the swords to attack him back. 
When picking 15 swords, the player has enough strengh to defeat the dragon and wins the game.
